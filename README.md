# **Credit Card Default Prediction Project Overview**
##**Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to develop an effective logistic regression model for binary classification. By analyzing the provided features, we aim to create a model that can predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a credit card loan.

The code for the workflow, along with interpretations, has been provided in the Jupyter Notebook (ipynb).
